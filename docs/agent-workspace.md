# Native agent workspace

Agent Threads preserves harness-native child agents as durable `AgentRun` records. Agent status never crowds out the conversation.

When Claude or Codex reports an agent, a compact pill appears in the composer footer showing how many agents are working (or how many failed, or a plain count once everything has finished). The pill is always visible while agents exist; it disappears, and the footer returns to its normal hover-only behavior, once the thread has no agent runs at all.

Click the pill to open a popover above the composer listing every agent in the thread, indented by parent. Arrow keys move between rows, `Escape` closes it, and clicking outside dismisses it.

Selecting an agent replaces the message pane with that agent's harness-exposed activity, lifecycle, errors, and result, without creating a separate thread. A sticky breadcrumb at the top (`Main conversation › parent › child`) walks back up the tree, and a close button returns to the conversation directly. Your scroll position in the main conversation is restored when you come back.

The composer stays live while a child view is open. Its placeholder notes that a message goes to the main conversation, and sending one visibly returns you there rather than silently redirecting.

## Choosing the harness at kickoff

The Agents List and Agent Board dispatch controls show the harness that will own the new thread. A normal click dispatches with the shown Claude or Codex harness. Right-click, press and hold, or focus the button and press `Shift+F10` to choose the other harness without sending. The selection remains local to that mounted view; the Agent harness setting is only its initial default, and changing the kickoff selection never switches an existing thread.

The Agents List groups conversations by resolved Project and orders adaptive two-line rows into Working, Waiting, New, Reviewed, Failed, and Ready sections. Status, title, and recency occupy the primary line; activity, repository/path, and agent count share a truncation-safe secondary line. Permission, question, plan, waiting, and AWS reauthentication states expand into dedicated action rows when required. Child-agent activity is summarized by one accessible agent-count control that opens the team picker without changing the current selection. The count is green only while at least one child is starting, working, or waiting; otherwise it uses the faint secondary treatment in both the list and Agent Board. Agent role, task, and current activity remain included in list search.

## Codex proactive agents and questions

Codex native agents remain available when the model explicitly delegates work. To let Codex decide proactively when parallel agents help, select **Codex effort level → Ultra** in Agent settings. Agent Threads passes `effort: "ultra"` only when the selected model advertises it; unsupported combinations stop before the turn with a clear error. The deprecated Codex `multiAgentMode` setting is never sent.

Codex can also pause for structured input through its native `request_user_input` protocol. These prompts use the same persisted desktop/mobile card and relay/reload path as Claude questions, while preserving Codex question IDs, option descriptions, free-form behavior, and secret-field masking. Default-mode input is enabled through app-server feature discovery, so older Codex binaries continue to work without receiving unsupported flags.

## Current capability matrix

| Harness | Stable child ID | Lifecycle/activity | Parent linkage | Direct message from UI | Interrupt one agent from UI |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Claude Agent SDK 0.3.233 | Yes (`task_id`) | Yes (`task_started`, `task_updated`, `task_progress`, notifications) | Used when `parent_task_id` is present | No verified public `Query` method | No verified public `Query` method |
| Codex app-server | Yes (`receiverThreadIds`, `agentThreadId`) | Yes (`collabAgentToolCall`, `agentsStates`, `subAgentActivity`) | Used when the event provides `senderThreadId`/`parentThreadId` | No verified host-callable path | No verified host-callable path |

The Claude SDK defines model-invoked `SendMessage` and `TaskStop` tool inputs, but its public host-side `Query` surface exposes only whole-query interruption. Agent Threads does not pretend those model tools are direct UI controls. Codex collaboration events similarly prove observation, not a callable host control. Consequently, the agent activity view explains that direct message and single-agent interrupt are unavailable, and never redirects an attempted child action to `main`.

## Persistence and recovery

Agent runs are persisted with their owning thread in plugin data. Terminal history survives reload. A run that was active when Obsidian closed is restored as **unavailable** until its harness reports live activity again. Duplicate native events are replay-safe, and a child whose parent arrives later is reattached automatically.

Background shell jobs and local workflow phases remain ordinary tasks; they are not promoted to conversational agents.
